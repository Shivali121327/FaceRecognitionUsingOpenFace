# FaceRecognitionUsingOpenFace
OpenFace is a Python and Torch implementation of face recognition with deep neural networks and is based on the CVPR 2015 paper FaceNet: A Unified Embedding for Face Recognition and Clustering by Florian Schroff, Dmitry Kalenichenko, and James Philbin at Google. 

Torch allows the network to be executed on a CPU or with CUDA.

The model is trained on 500K images using the datasets FaceScrub and CASIA-WebFace. It has a accuracy of 92.9% on the LFW benchmark.
